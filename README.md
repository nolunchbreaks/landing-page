# Server Provisioning on AWS EC2
1. Logged into the AWS Management Console.
2. Created a new EC2 instance with the following configuration:
AMI: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
Instance Type: t2.micro (Free Tier)
Key Pair: I used an existing one for SSH access.
Security Group: Allowed inbound rules for HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and SSH (port 22).
3.Launched the instance successfully and noted its Public IP Address: 3.84.13.68
4. Accessing the EC2 Instance via SSH
5. Opened a terminal and connected to the server using SSH:
6. ssh -i my-aws-key.pem ubuntu@3.84.13.68
8. Switched to the root user: sudo -I
9. Installing and Configuring Apache Server
10. Updated the server:
apt update -y
2. Installed Apache Web Server:
apt install -y apache2
3. Verified Apache status:
systemctl status apache2
4. Enabled Apache to start on boot:
systemctl enable apache2
4. Deploying the GitHub Project Files

1. Created a project directory:
mkdir Landing-page 
cd landing-page
2. Downloaded the project files from GitHub:
  https://github.com/nolunchbreaks/landing-page/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
3. Installed unzip and extracted the files:
apt install unzip  
unzip main.zip
4. Moved the files to Apacheâ€™s root directory:
cd Landing-page
mv * /var/www/html/  
cd /var/www/html/  
ls -lrt
5. Restarted Apache to reflect changes:
systemctl restart apache2

Domain and SSL certificate
1.I got a domain (osagieanolu.engineer) from name.com and I linked my IP addr to it
2. I installed Snapd-----apt install Snapd
3. Installed certbot via snap-------sudo snap install --classic certbot
4. Prepare Certbot Command------sudo certbot --apache
5. Follow Certbot Prompts
  Enter your email address.
  Agree to the terms of service.
  Choose whether to share your email with the EFF.
6. Verify the Installation-------sudo certbot certificates
7. Automate Renewal-------sudo crontab -e
8. 0 0,12 * * * sudo certbot renew --quiet

The HTML project was successfully deployed on AWS EC2 and secured with SSL/TLS using Certbot.
